SampleWakeLock
==============

To demonstrate partial wake lock, I have implemented a timer which prints current time for every second. As I have acquired a 
partial wake lock irrespective of whether the screen is locked or the app is minimized the timer is executed. 

Press start button to start the timer
and  stop button to stop the timer
